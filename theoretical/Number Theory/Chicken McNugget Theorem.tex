\subsection{Chicken McNugget Theorem}

The Chicken McNugget Theorem states that for any two relatively prime positive integers $m, n$, the greatest integer that cannot be written in the form $am + bn$ for nonnegative integers $a, b$ is $mn-m-n$.\\

A consequence of the theorem is that there are exactly $\frac{(m - 1)(n - 1)}{2}$ positive integers which cannot be expressed in the form $am + bn$. The proof is based on the fact that in each pair of the form $(k, mn-m-n-k)$, exactly one element is expressible.
